# timelymeetings.com

A simple no-frills app that starts counting down how much time is left in your current meeting. 

Key features (So far)

* **Notifications** - The app will leverage browser notifications if available. It will fall back to old school alert popups if notifications are not available (e.g. Mobile iOS Safari) or disabled.
* **Auto-detect Meeting Start Time** - The application will auto-detect when your meeting start time so you do not need to do any math to determine how much time is left. But, you can adjust this if needed.
* **Resume Support** - The meeting configuration is saved in the browser, so if you refresh or recreate the browser window the count down will pick up where it left off.
* **Mobile Support** - While designed to be kept open in a small window on your screen, feel free to pull up the app on your mobile phone. This might be useful if you are sharing your screen on a Zoom call or need the entire desktop for your work.
